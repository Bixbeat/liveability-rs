# liveability-rs

This work contains the code used to train models as in our paper "Predicting the Liveability of Dutch Cities With Aerial Images and Semantic Intermediate Concepts". This repository contains code which has been refactored slightly. A snapshot of the exact code to reproduce our models can be found in the following zip file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LgMcvGK1TnuEZSaXJOTs-pDtfT9nnOfU/view?usp=share_link

The zip file contains the code as well as the spatial outputs for our RGB model. 

 The dataset will be uploaded to Zotero on 26/01/2023.
